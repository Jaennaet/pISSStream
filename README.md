# pISSStream

pISSStream is a macOS menu bar app that shows how full the International Space Station's urine tank is in real time:

[Download](https://github.com/Jaennaet/pISSStream/releases/download/v0.2/pISSStream.dmg) yours while supplies last!

Uses NASA's official public ISS telemetry stream, provided by [Lightstreamer](https://lightstreamer.com/).

## Usage

When pISSStream can connect to Lightstreamer and the ISS telemetry signal is being received by the ground station, the menu bar item shows üßëüèΩ‚ÄçüöÄüöΩ alongside  the fill percentage, and the menu simply reads "Connected"

If either the connection to Lightstreamer or the ISS telemetry signal itself is lost, the menu bar item shows üßëüèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ‚ùóand the last received value if any, and the menu reads either "Connection Lost" or "Signal Lost (LOS)":

## But why?

For some inexplicable reason people keep asking me why I (@Jaennaet) did this.

My motivation was entirely that I thought this was both a hilariously stupid use of a space station's telemetry stream, but also kind of amazing at the same time. It's remarkable that we live in a world where it takes an afternoon to bang out a joke application that reads actual realtime telemetry data from a space station's toilets. 

Also a great excuse to learn Swift, but the sheer ridiculousness was what drove me.

## Bugs

Not the epitome of good coding practices since this was my first Swift & macOS app ever, may break in exciting ways at the slightest excuse.

- shrugs at stale data
- not overly bothered with error handling

## Errata

I found out about the data stream from https://iss-mimic.github.io/Mimic/, which has considerably more and more interesting stats than just how full the piss tank is. 

I will not be adding any of them.

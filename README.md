## Features

- Real-time ISS urine tank level monitoring
- macOS menu bar integration
- iOS app with live updates
- visionOS immersive 3D visualization
- Uses NASA's official public ISS telemetry stream via [Lightstreamer](https://lightstreamer.com/)

### iOS & visionOS
Due to Apple's security model, you'll need to build from source and sign with your own developer account:

1. Prerequisites:
   - Xcode 15.2 or later
   - Apple Developer account
   - iOS 17.0+ device for iOS app
   - Apple Vision Pro or visionOS simulator for spatial computing

2. Build steps:
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jaennaet/pISSStream.git
cd pISSStream

# Open in Xcode
open pISSStream.xcodeproj
```

3. In Xcode:
- Select your development team in the Signing & Capabilities tab
- Choose your target device (iPhone/macOS or Vision Pro)
- Build and run (‚åòR)

Note: If you don't have an Apple Developer account, you can still run the app in the simulator or on your device for up to 7 days using a free provisioning profile.

For **visionOS** development, you'll need the visionOS SDK installed in Xcode. The app uses the ImmersiveSpace API for the 3D visualization experience.

## Requirements
- Mac with Apple silicon
- Xcode 15.2+
- Apple Developer Account
- Vision Pro with developer mode enabled
- Mac and Vision Pro on same Wi-Fi network

#### Wireless Development
1. On Vision Pro:
   - Settings > General > Developer > Enable Developer Mode
   - Settings > Privacy & Security > Allow Remote Development

2. Connect Vision Pro:
   - Open Xcode
   - Window > Devices and Simulators
   - Click '+' to add Vision Pro
   - Follow pairing instructions

3. Build & Deploy:
   - Select Vision Pro as build target
   - Product > Run (‚åòR)

#### Common Issues
- "Device not found": Check Wi-Fi connection
- "Unauthorized device": Re-pair Vision Pro
- "Build failed": Update provisioning profile
- Error "No paired Vision Pro found": Ensure Vision Pro is connected and paired
- "Invalid signing": Verify developer account and provisioning profile

## Usage

#### macOS
When pISSStream can connect to Lightstreamer and the ISS telemetry signal is being received by the ground station, the menu bar item shows üßëüèΩ‚ÄçüöÄüöΩ alongside the fill percentage, and the menu simply reads "Connected"

If either the connection to Lightstreamer or the ISS telemetry signal itself is lost, the menu bar item shows üßëüèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ‚ùóand the last received value if any, and the menu reads either "Connection Lost" or "Signal Lost (LOS)":

#### iOS
Launch the app to view the current tank level in a simple interface.

## But why?

For some inexplicable reason people keep asking me why I ([@Jaennaet](https://github.com/Jaennaet)) did this.

My motivation was entirely that I thought this was both a hilariously stupid use of a space station's telemetry stream, but also kind of amazing at the same time. It's remarkable that we live in a world where it takes an afternoon to bang out a joke application that reads actual realtime telemetry data from a space station's toilets.

Also a great excuse to learn Swift, but the sheer ridiculousness was what drove me.

## Known Issues

Not the epitome of good coding practices since this was my first Swift & Apple platforms app ever, may break in exciting ways at the slightest excuse.

At the very least:

- shrugs at stale data
- Not overly bothered with error handling

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes.

## Errata
[@Jaennaet](https://github.com/Jaennaet) found out about the data stream from https://iss-mimic.github.io/Mimic/, which has considerably more and more interesting stats than just how full the piss tank is.

We will not be adding any of them.
